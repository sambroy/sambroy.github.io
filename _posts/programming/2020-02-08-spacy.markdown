In this post, we will consider some aspects of spaCy that I had to work with. 

Suppose we have a sentence 
{% highlight python %}
s1 = "This is an ad-hoc request."
s2 = "This is an ad - hoc request."
{% endhighlight %}

The only difference between s1 and s2 is that there's extra space between the hyphen and the words. Let's proceed with ingesting this in spaCy. 

{% highlight python %}
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

def get_tokens(s):
    doc = nlp(s)
    toks = []
    for token in doc:
        toks.append(token)
    return toks

toks1 = get_tokens(s1)
toks2 = get_tokens(s2)
assert (toks1 == toks2)
{% endhighlight %}
