<h1>An excursion on Functional Equations.</h1>


<div>
    <ul class="topics">
        <li><a href="blog.html">high school math</a></li>
        <li><a href="blog.html">olympiads</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>


<p>

<h3>TL;DR: </h3>
<p>In this post, we discuss some functional equations leading to the (somewhat tricky)
    functional equation that appeared in this year's
    <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=2017">International Mathematics Olympiad
        (IMO 2017)</a> held at Rio, Brazil this month.
</p>

<h3>Target Audience:</h3>
High-school students, puzzle enthusiasts.

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
The beauty of functional equations (FE in short) is that it does not require much beyond high
school mathematics, as far as techniques go.

<h3>Background and Why:</h3>
<p>
    Functional equations have always been a personal favorite, ever since I got
    introduced to them in the IMO Training Camp, way back in 1993, by
    Dr. B. J. Venkatchala (BJV in short to students).
    They also appear to be
    favorites for problems at olympiads, perhaps because they do not require much formal
    training, but some level of ingenuity in solving them.
</p>
<p>
    The aim in this post is to <i>elucidate</i> the thought process that goes into
    solving such FEs, and also to motivate the reader to <i>create</i> interesting
    new FEs (and who knows, even propose them for the IMO!).
</p>

<h3>Resources:</h3>
<p>
    There are good resources available for FEs, some of which are online.
    <ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://web.evanchen.cc/handouts/FuncEq-Intro/FuncEq-Intro.pdf">This article</a>
        by <a href="http://web.evanchen.cc/">Evan Chen</a> is quite comprehensive.
        The interested reader may want to check out the recipes for solving FEs as outlined
        in that article.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dr. B. J. Venkatchala has written a
        <a href="http://www.amazon.in/Functional-Equations-Revised-Updated-2nd/dp/8172867816">book</a>
        on the topic. This is a good read for Olympiad enthusiasts.
    </li>
    <li>
        Another fantastic resource for Olympiad material is the site,
        <a href="http://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=IMO_Problems_and_Solutions">
            The Art of Problem Solving
        </a>.
    </li>
    <li>Another resource that I have not really gotten time to look more into, but
    seems pretty useful is <a href="http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=338">this</a>
    site by Marko Radovanovic.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The Story:</h3>
In this post, we will do the following:
<ul>
    <li>
        We will highlight the problem that appeared in IMO 2017
    </li>
    <li>
        We will solve some other problems, to get warmed up.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then come back to attack the IMO 2017 FE problem.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>The problem:</h4>
The problem that appeared as Problem 2 in the IMO 2017 reads as follows.
This problem was posed by Dorlir Ahmeti who has also proposed beautiful FE problems for other
IMOs
(such as <a href="http://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=2015_IMO_Problems/Problem_5">Problem 5 in IMO 2015</a>).
For the purpose of this post, we will call this
<p>
    <b>Problem 1:</b>
    Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the set of real numbers. Determine all functions
    $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, such that, for all real numbers
    $x$ and $y$,
    $$
    f(f(x)f(y)) + f(x+y) = f(xy)
    $$
</p>

<h4>Tips before we proceed:</h4>
Here are some tips that might help in attacking FE problems.
<ol>
    <li>
        First try to memorize the very statement of the problem. How does this
        help? In order to memorize the statement, you are involuntarily forced
        to engage with the problem and break it up into chunks that you can
        remember.
        <br>
        For instance, for the above, we would thereby internalize that on the
        LHS the first term <i>looks like</i> $f(f())$, while the other terms consist of a single
        application of $f$.
    </li>
    <li>
        Homogeneous vs. non-homogeneous. As we can see above, all of the terms
        in the FE of Problem 1 contain a $f()$ term, i.e. this is a homogenous
        FE. Cauchy's FE (see this <a href="http://web.evanchen.cc/handouts/FuncEq-Intro/FuncEq-Intro.pdf">article</a>
        for instance)
        is also homogeneous. Problem 3 below would be an example of a non-homogeneous FE.
        A homogeneous FE will always have the solution $f(x) = 0$ for instance.
    </li>
    <li>
        The above are in addition to the usual tips that apply to such problems: set usual values
        (say, $0$, $1$) for
        the variables in the FE (here, its $x$, $y$). For more such tips/tricks,
        refer to <a href="http://web.evanchen.cc/handouts/FuncEq-Intro/FuncEq-Intro.pdf">this exposition</a>.
    </li>
    <li>For brevity, call the given FE as $P(x, y)$ so that it is easier to
    index/remember which values of $x$ and $y$ are being substituted, and what is the
    outcome of a specific substitution.</li>
    <li>
        This tip is a no-brainer but is at times easy to overlook. Given a FE,
        the first effort should be to conjure up (at least) one solution that
        "seems to fit" the FE. For some FEs this may be harder than it appears
        at first - that should be an indication of the difficulty of the FE.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the other direction, while having a solution at hand that does fit the
        FE, one should also be open to the possibility of other solutions.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>The problem(s):</h4>
We will warm up to the IMO 2017 problem via a few other
<i>building blocks</i>. We will also encounter/solve some other
problems along the way.
<p>
    <b>
        Problem 2:
    </b>
    Let $\mathbb{R}$ denote the set of all real numbers, and let
    $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be such that
    $$
    f(f(x)) = x
    $$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
    Prove that $f$ is $1-1$ (i.e. injective) and onto; thus
    <i>bijective</i>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Solution: </b>
    <br>
    Let's see injectivity first. For this, we would need to prove
    $$
    f(x) = f(y) \implies x = y
    $$
    So, suppose that we have $x, y$ such that $f(x) = f(y)$.
    Apply $f$ once more to get $f(f(x)) = x$ and $f(f(y)) = y$.
    Together these equations give that
    $f(f(x)) = f(f(y)) = x = y$, thus implying $x = y$.
    <br>
    Proving that $f$ is <i>onto</i> is even simpler. Given any $x$,
    the function $f$ maps $f(x)$ to the value $x$. Thus, $f$ is
    onto. Done. Finito. Sweet.
    <br>
    Thus we have shown that $f$ is a bijection.
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Problem 2a:
    </b>
    Same circumstance as in Problem 2, just that $f(f(x)) = x + a$ for
    every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, where $a \in \mathbb{R}$ is a <i>constant</i>.
    Prove that $f$ is a bijection.
</p>
<p>
    This should be easy to see, following the same steps as for Problem 2.
</p>
<p>
<b>Problem 3:</b>
Let $\mathbb{R}$ denote the set of all real numbers. Find all functions
$f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that
$$
f(x^2 + f(y)) = y + f(x)^2
$$
for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Solution Approach:</b>
    <br>
    The solution approach will be to break up the problem as follows.
    We fix the notation such that we refer to the FE with variables $x$
and $y$ as $P(x, y)$.
    <h5>Baby-step 1: Bijectivity</h5>
    We will first substitute common
    values (say, $x = 0/1$, $y = 0/1$) to derive outcomes from $P(x, y)$.
    Using $P(0, y)$ we see that
\begin{equation}
f(f(y)) = y + f(0)^2
\label{eqn:1}
\end{equation}
Thus, by <b>Problem 2a</b>, $f$ is a bijection.

    <h5>Baby-step 2: Find individual values of $f(x)$ for a few specific
    choices of $x$</h5>
    The goal here is to perhaps elucidate the $f()$ landscape from these
    specific values.
    <br>
Oftentimes, one may feel that this part of the exercise turns out to be
the most useless, since often, some of the values found do not really
participate directly in the final solution. Nevertheless, this is an important
step in that, it moulds our thought and intuition about the problem.
</p>
<p>
    Let us go through such an exercise for this FE. We can for instance
    set $y = 0$ in the equation above to get $f(f(0)) = f(0)^2$.
</p>
<h5>Baby-step 3:</h5>
This is not really an aim but more like a procedure/tip. The idea is
to <i>neutralize</i> as many terms in the FE as possible. While at times
this is achieved by substituting $x = 0$ or $y = 0$, at times we may
also try by placing $f(c) = 0$ for some $c$. Considering $P(x, c)$ we get
$$
f(x^2 + f(c)) = c + f(x)^2
$$
which is equivalent to $f(x^2) = c + f(x)^2$ (since $f(c) = 0$).

<h5>Baby-step 4: figure out $f(0)$.</h5>
<span style="color:#7c00b9">This is where the magic really happens</span>, when we realise that we can
apply $f$ to either side of the FE and get something reasonable
courtesy Equation \eqref{eqn:1}.
$$
f(f(x^2 + f(y)) = f(y + f(x)^2)
$$
To the LHS, we apply Baby-step 1 to get that
$$
f(y + f(x)^2) = x^2 + f(y) + f(0)^2
$$
But now notice that if we place $c$ such that $f(c) = 0$, this equation becomes
$$
f(y + f(c)^2) = c^2 + f(y) + f(0)^2.
$$
which means $f(y) = c^2 + f(y) + f(0)^2$, or in other words
$c^2 + f(0)^2 = 0$. This implies that $c = 0$ and $f(0) = 0$.

But, what if there is not such a $c$ i.e. no such $c$ such that $f(c) = 0$?
Well, we proved that $f$ is <i>surjective</i> (i.e. onto), so this cannot
happen!

<p>
    Let's recap what we have so far:
    <ul>
    <li>$f(0) = 0$</li>
    <li>$f$ is 1-1, onto.</li>
    <li>$f(f(y)) = y$ for all $y$ (Baby-step $1$ with our new knowledge, $f(0) = 0$)</li>
</ul>
At this point it will also help to recall the original FE:
$$
f(x^2 + f(y)) = y + f(x)^2
$$
</p>
<h5>Baby-step 5: figure out $f(1)$.</h5>
<p>
    This will involve sprinkling $P(x, y)$ with lots of settings where
    $x$ or $y$ (or both) are $1$, while making use of what we learnt above.
    Let's start!

    <ul>
    <li>$P(1, 1) \implies f(1 + f(1)) = 1 + f(1)^2$</li>
    <li>$P(1, 0) \implies f(1) = f(1)^2$</li>
</ul>
Aha! So $P(1, 0)$ implies that $f(1) = 0$ or $f(1) = 1$. If $f(1) = 0$,
then use $P(1, 1)$ to show that $f(1 + 0) = 1 + 0$ i.e. $f(1)  = 1$ -
a clear contradiction!
<br>
So $f(1) = 1$. How about $f(2)$? Again, $P(1, 1)$ directly gives
$f(2) = 2$. Hmm... maybe we are now in reach of
showing that $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}$?
</p>

<h5>Baby-step 6: prove $f(x) = x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}$.</h5>
This is pretty much the same as the calculation in Baby-step 5, where
instead of considering $P(1, 0)$ we will consider $P(1, y)$ to get
$$
f(1 + f(y)) = y + 1
$$
That doesn't seem to help us much does it? But wait, we know a couple of things
about $f$: that $f$ is 1-1 (i.e. injective), and that $f(f(y))= y$. So that means
$f(f(y + 1)) = y + 1$, and injectivity implies now that
$$
1 + f(y) = f(y + 1)
$$
Whoa! we are done with our aim for this baby-step (for instance, by induction on $y$,
moving both <i>back</i> as well as <i>forward</i> from $y = 0$ to cover all
the integers).

<h5>Baby-step 7:</h5>
<b>Target:</b> The only target left now is to prove $f(x) = x$ for all
$x \in \mathbb{R}$.
