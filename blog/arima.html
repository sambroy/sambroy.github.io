<h1>ARIMA for demand forecasting.</h1>

<p>

<h3>TL;DR: </h3>
<p>In this short article, we work on a problem, using ARIMA and teasing out the various considerations
    in regard to the problem.
</p>

<h3>Target Audience:</h3>
Data Scientists.

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Some notion of time-series analysis.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Understanding the data</h4>
Altogether, the data has 5 fields:
<ul>
    <li>
    rpc: the product code; overall there are 140 product codes in the given data.
    </li>
    <li>
        date: over a time horizon of 262 days from 2014-11-12 to 2015-07-31.
    </li>
    <li>
        sales: this is a numeric field of type integer.
    </li>
    <li>
        price: this is a numeric field of type float.
    </li>
    <li>
        promo: this is a binary variable.
    </li>
    <li>
        oos: out of stock - again, a binary variable.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Approaches:</h4>
There are (at least) three different approaches to this problem.
<ul>
    <li><i>ARIMA models:</i>
    This approach consists of ARIMA models and their variants (ARIMAX, VAR, etc.)
    </li>
    <li><i>Random Effects Models:</i>
        Note that the underlying technique for an ARIMA model is actually linear regression, with the regressors chosen
        suitably, to take the temporal nature of the problem into account. Thus, one other approach can be to use
        the recently in-fashion regression models, such as Random/Mixed Effects models (also called Generalized
        Additive Models). Recently, Facebook opensourced a forecaster
        they call <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/02/facebook-prophet.html">Prophet</a>
        that uses GAM. We will
        have a preliminary dive-deep into this in order to understand whether they give better RMSE for our problem.
    </li>
    <li><i>Recurrent Neural Network Architectures:</i>
    Given the sequential nature of a time-series, it is natural to think of applying a recurrent network
        architecture (more specifically, gated RNNs such as LSTMs, GRUs) to this problem.
     Time permitting,
        we will use some of these models for comparison. Also, it should be noted that given that there are only at most
        262 data points for each rpc code, it is not clear how much a recurrent network can learn from the data.
    </li>
</ul>
For each of these approaches, the considerations below apply.

<h4>Baseline:</h4>
Given the many approaches that we have, what could be a suitable baseline? We choose the ARIMA model without
exogenous variables as a baseline.

<h4>Considerations:</h4>
The following considerations apply to the problem; as such all of the above models will need to address these
in one way or another.
    <ul>
    <li><i>Missing Data:</i>
    The overall time horizon of the data is 262 days. For every RPC, it turns out that the dates for which we do have
        data, are <i>consecutive</i>. For 54 of these RPCs, we have data for all the 262 days.
        For some RPCs, we have data for just 1 day (or 3 days, etc.). It is not entirely clear as to whether
        this scenario can be considered as one with missing data.
        Typical approaches deal with missing data via imputation. Imputation uses several techniques such as Kalman filters,
        or (slightly more na&iuml;ve) moving average approaches.
    </li>
    <li><i>Stationarity:</i>
        Understand the autocorrelations in the data, as well as whether the data is covariance-stationary.
    This will involve plotting the ACF and the PACF functions. This will help in determining the lag factor of
    the ARIMA model (i.e. the 'q' where q is for the MA lag).
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Classification of variables:</i> We classify the variables as follows: the variable 'sales' is
        <i>endogenous</i>, and the variables 'price', 'oos', and 'promo' are all <i>exogenous</i>.
    </li>
        <li>
            <i>Sparsity of regressors:</i>
            The exogenous variable 'oos' and 'promo' are sparse/rare at times. For instance, if we have a 70:30 split of the
            data for a RPC code, then at times it turns out that oos is uniformly 0 across the training set. How does
            this lead to a problem? This cannot therefore be a predictor and the model cannot learn from this
            variable. Consequently, the ARIMA model fitting routine spits out
            an error if we try to use this as an exogenous variable.
        </li>
 <li>
      <i>Data Preprocessing:</i>
     Normalization of the sales and the prices. This is when we are considering multiple rpc codes at the same time.
        </li>
    <li>
        <i>RPC codes as exogenous variables:</i>
        How about rpc codes as exogenous variables? There are two ways of handling this:
        (1) Either have separate model for each rpc code. This is the approach we are taking currently.
        (2) Build a single model where the rpc code is also a exogenous variable. However, now the model needs to be
        a VAR (vector ARIMA) model, since we would be outputting the 140-length vector corresponding to the 140 rpc codes.

        An advantage of the second approach would be that the model can <i>utilize correlations</i> across the various rpc
        codes, etc. However for this approach, we would need to carefully normalize/standardize the data across rpc codes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Casting integers as floats:</i> The sales column has type integers. How do we fit these into a ARIMA model?
        Make them into floats, and then let ARIMA predict floats, and we will round up or down.
        Which one do we use: rounding up or down?
    </li>
    <li>
        Finding out ARIMAX parameters from the data.
    </li>
        <li><i>Choice of Language:</i>
        Given my comfort with Python over R, I chose Python. Though at times, it felt like I should move to R since
        there's a lot of online support for desired functionalities.
        </li>
</ul>
