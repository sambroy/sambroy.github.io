<h1>The Right Wrong Way</h1>

<p>One overarching interest of mine is to understand how problems are solved. Core to this issue is the other question:
what do we mean by "understanding" itself? A problem rarely "lives" by itself - it co-exists in the neighborhood of
other similar problems, some easier, some harder. To my mind, understanding a problem principally involves understanding
this neighborhood, creating a rich fabric of related problems.

More often than not, it is a wrong approach that leads us to the correct approach to solving a problem. At times,
it is a matter of enumerating wrong approaches, while there may be more efficient ways of ruling out approaches that
lead to dead ends. Spending the time on wrong approaches can also be thought
of as engaging with the problem on a deeper level in order to really understand what does work for solving the problem.

This blog will primarily consist of discussions of various problems/algorithms/papers equipped with wrong approaches, hopefully
guiding us to the correct view of a result.
</p>

<p>
I will be organizing my writings into a couple of categories, depending on the target audience:
   <ul>
    <li>Expository articles with a focus on <i>high-school mathematics</i>. One of my strong beliefs is that mathematics does not
    need to be hard - it becomes hard when it stops being play. These articles are an effort to rekindle that spirit of play
    that underlies exploration and search for beautiful ideas in mathematics.</li>
    <li>Articles on <i>data science, machine learning</i> and <i>programming</i>. As a component of understanding
    "understanding", it is important to tease out the simplest parts that constitute the whole of a
    mathematical argument, to see the interplay between the various argumental pieces. These writings are aimed
    towards that goal, to elucidate the underpinnings of familiar algorithms/techniques.</li>
    <li>Paper Discussions. This is my humble effort to engage with, and understand the papers I am
    going through currently. I am hoping also to accompany the discussions with code walkthroughs
    when appropriate.</li>
</ul>

	  In this short note, we discuss and dissect a program for generating all the combinations of a collection/set of $n$ characters, $r$ at a time.
For $r$-combinations of $n$ objects, the program will generate all $n \choose r$ combinations.

<h3>Articles:</h3>
<p>
The following consists of some surveys or observations in the course of reading various papers.
    These are more like notes on specific papers rather than surveys. These short notes are largely informal; at times they are a study of a specific part of a paper. Constructive comments (such as better ways to view a result, mistakes in understanding points of the papers) are welcome. The writing of these notes is primarily for purposes of clarification of my own understanding.
At some point I would like to revisit these and clean/incorporate these in the blog above, but for now I will leave the
    pdfs on here.
