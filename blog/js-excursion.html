<h1>Code-walkthrough: An excursion in JavaScript.</h1>

<div>
    <ul class="topics">
        <li><a href="blog.html">programming</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>

<h3>TL;DR: </h3>
We go through and dissect some JavaScript code for a popular game on FaceBook.

<h3>Target Audience:</h3>
Programming enthusiasts.

</p>

<h4>Overall Structure of app.js</h4>
The overall structure looks like this:
var a, b;<br>
initialize a, initialize b;<br>
var d, main, startGame, setScore, h, getTime, handleTap, results; <br>
call main(); <br>

<h3>What:</h3>
<p>
    Many of us might have seen the principle at work without being aware that this has a name.
    The essential idea is to count objects in different ways, to yield surprising results.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini%27s_theorem">principle of Fubini</a> referred to
    in this post, corresponds to double integrations where
    the order of integrating over $x$ or over $y$ does not matter. There are certain
    conditions under which such integrations can be conducted; however that is not the
    focus of this short note. (The interested reader may check out the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini%27s_theorem">wiki</a> page for details
    as to when we can perform the double integration in this manner).
</p>
<p>
    In this short note, we illustrate Fubini's principle in combinatorics and counting.
</p>

<h3>How:</h3>
This is how we will proceed wrt this topic.
<ul>
    <li>We will describe the basic idea behind this counting technique.</li>
    <li>We will demonstrate the use of this via some examples.</li>
    <li>The <b>icing</b>: we will show how one can create new problems from old, by
        tweaking the various assumptions involved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About the technique.</h3>
<p>
    The basic idea behind the method is simplicity itself. The technique deals with
    different ways of counting some combinatorial entities/objects; since we are
    essentially counting the same collection of objects, the counts should be the same.
</p>
<p>
    Here is a short summary of the technique: suppose you have a $2\mathbf{D}$ matrix of
    $0$s and $1$s, then counting the $1$'s by the rows or counting the $1$'s along
    the columns should yield the same sum: the total number of $1$'s in the matrix!
    <br><br>
    Here, the "combinatorial object" that we are counting are the $1$'s in the matrix.
    The two ways of counting (via rows, or via columns) is tantamount to two "views" on the
    same table/matrix.
</p>
<p>
    While this may sound rather trivial, it is amazing how such a simple idea can have
    really far-reaching consequences. But this is quite common in Mathematics in general,
    a rather simple <i>kernel</i> of an idea can have numerous ramifications.
</p>

<h3>Examples:</h3>
As promised, we are going to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique via
examples.
<br>
<br>
The first example appeared as
<a href="https://www.imo-official.org/problems.aspx">
    Problem 2
    </a>
(on Day 1) in the 1998
<a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=1998">
    International Mathematics Olympiad.
</a>
<h4>Example 1:</h4>
In a contest, there are $m$ candidates and $n$ judges, where $n \geqslant 3$ is an odd integer.
Each candidate is evaluated by each judge as either pass or fail.
Suppose that each pair of judges agrees on at most $k$ candidates.
Prove that
$$
\frac{k}{m} \geqslant \frac{n-1}{2n}
$$

<h4>First Thoughts:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        The <i>interactions</i> indicated in the problem are primarily between candidates and judges.
        Thus if we were to model the candidates and judges are vertices in a graph, this would
        correspond to a <i>bipartite</i> graph.
    </li>
    <li>
        At the outset, it is always a good idea to start fixing some notation/indexing.
        <ul>
            <li>We will label the Judges by the letter $J$ and the candidates by $C$.</li>
            <li>
                Typical indexing considerations go as follows: since the word
                judge starts with the letter j, while we would like to denote the judges as
                $J_{\star}$, it would be preferable not to index them by $j$ itself (imagine
                how $J_j$ would sound/look!).
            </li>
            <li>However, while $J_k$ sounds nice, we cannot use $k$ for indexing, since
                $k$ already means something in this problem! So running through the alphabet,
                let's choose another letter to index the judges. For this post, our choice
                is $r$. So the judges are $J_1, J_2, \cdots, J_r, \cdots, J_n$. For fun, we can use
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_judges">this list</a>
                of judges for names.
            </li>
            <li>For the candidates, we are free to use $i$, so $C_1, \cdots, C_i, \cdots, C_m$ are the
                candidates.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        &Agrave; priori, it is not clear why we have the restriction that $n$ is an <i>odd</i>
        integer. However, let us call this out here, so that this is a question that the
        reader carries in mind, throughout the following to see whether we need this extra
        condition at all. We should also note that there are <i>at least</i> two places where
        the number $2$ figures prominently in this problem - one is in the parity of $n$ (that
        $n$ is <i>odd</i>) and also in the fraction $\frac{n-1}{2n}$ (which is really close to
        $\frac{1}{2}$). In fact there is one more implicit way in which the number $2$ figures
        in this problem: can the reader figure out where?
    </li>
    <li>Some basic sanity checks.
        Note the wording of the problem: every pair of judges
        agrees on <i>at most</i> $k$ candidates. So for a specific scenario if a number $k_0$
        satisfies this restriction, so also does $k_0 + 1$. Thus, the <i>direction</i> of the
        inequality $\frac{k}{m} \geqslant \frac{n-1}{2n}$ is correct. If $k=k_0$ satisfies
        this inequality so also does $k_0 + 1$. This may seem almost facetious right now -
        having realised the above flavor of the problem, we may rephrase the problem as considering the following quantity:
        $$\min_{\text{all scenarios}} \max_{\text{judge pairs}} (\text{agreements over candidates})$$
        Thus we recognize the problem as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax
            problem!</a>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Start off:</h4>
<p>
    Armed with the above, we turn our minds to modeling the problem. Clearly since there is no
    <i>direct</i> interaction between judges (or between candidates), we may model this
    as a <i>bipartite</i> graph. And of course, there is no better way to represent
    (the edges of ) a bipartite graph by its <b>bipartite adjacency matrix</b>, where we have
    (say) rows corresponding to the candidates and the columns corresponding to the judges.
    Here is an illustration for $n = 3$ judges and $m = 2$ candidates. Call this matrix
    $\mathbf{M}$.
</p>

<div class="wrapper2">
    <div class="box" style="opacity:0;"></div>
    <div class="box column-header">$J_1$</div>
    <div class="box column-header">$J_2$</div>
    <div class="box column-header">$J_3$</div>
    <div class="box row-header">$C_1$</div>
    <div class="box entry">P</div>
    <div class="box entry">F</div>
    <div class="box entry">P</div>
    <div class="box row-header">$C_2$</div>
    <div class="box entry">F</div>
    <div class="box entry">P</div>
    <div class="box entry">P</div>
</div>

<p>
    Given this specific setting, we may check that the right $k$ for this matrix is
    $k = 1$ (any pair of judges agree on at most $1$ candidate). Also note that the
    inequality in the problem does hold: $1/2 \geqslant 2/6$ ($k = 1$, $m = 2$, $n = 3$).
</p>

<h4>Transform:</h4>
<p>
    While the input is essentially the matrix above, we should rather be looking at the matrix
    that directly ties up with the minimax statement that we formulated. Look at the minimax
    statement again: it considers <i>judge pairs</i> instead of judges. This indicates that
    while the matrix representation above considers
    (candidate, judge) tuples, we should instead consider <i>tuples</i> of (candidate, judge pairs).
</p>
<p>
    How do we go from the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ above to this latter matrix? Also what should the
    <i>entries</i> of the transformed matrix be? Well, given a candidate and
    a pair of judges, the entry should be just "Agree" (A in short) or "Disagree" (D in short).
    Let us demonstrate
    the transformed matrix $\mathbf{T}$ corresponding to the above:
</p>
<div class="wrapper2">
    <div class="box" style="opacity:0;"></div>
    <div class="box column-header">$(J_1, J_2)$</div>
    <div class="box column-header">$(J_1, J_3)$</div>
    <div class="box column-header">$(J_2, J_3)$</div>
    <div class="box row-header">$C_1$</div>
    <div class="box entry">D</div>
    <div class="box entry">A</div>
    <div class="box entry">D</div>
    <div class="box row-header">$C_2$</div>
    <div class="box entry">D</div>
    <div class="box entry">D</div>
    <div class="box entry">A</div>
</div>
<p>
    Note that if the original matrix had $n$ columns corresponding to the judges, this
    new matrix $\mathbf{T}$ has $n\choose 2$ columns corresponding to <i>judge pairs</i>. The problem
    statement - in terms of this new matrix - translates to: <b>every column has
    at most $k$ A's</b>.
</p>

<h4>Enter Fubini</h4>
<p>Now the stage is set to make progress. We will think Fubini with the matrix $\mathbf{T}$.
    We have some handle of the counts (of A's) as per the columns - how about the rows?
</p>
<p>
    Consider candidate row $C_i$. This candidate gets evaluated by all the $n$ judges
    and gets $P$ or $F$ from each of them - let's give numbers here - suppose $C_i$
    gets $x_i$ $P$'s and $(n - x_i)$ $F$'s (we are keeping a subscript $i$ on the $x$
    here since this is happening for the candidate $C_i$). How many $A$'s and $D$'s
    does $C_i$ get in its row in the transformed matrix?
</p>
<p>
    Well this is easy to calculate. Every pair of $P$'s in $\mathbf{M}$
    gives rise to an $A$ in $\mathbf{T}$, <i>as also</i>
    every pair of $F$'s. Thus the total number of $A$'s in $C_i$'s row in
    $\mathbf{T}$ is ${x_i \choose 2} +{{n-x_i} \choose 2}$.
</p>
<p>
    Thus the number of $A$'s in the matrix $\mathbf{T}$ (summing over all
    <i>rows</i>) is:
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{i=m} {x_i \choose 2} + {{n-x_i} \choose 2}
    $$
</p>
<p>The number of $A$'s (summing over all columns now) is:
    $$
    \leqslant {n \choose 2}\times k
    $$
</p>
<p>
    Finally, matching up, we get:
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{i=m} {x_i \choose 2} + {{n-x_i} \choose 2} \leqslant {n \choose 2} k
    $$
</p>

<h4>D&eacute;nouement</h4>
<p>
    Now this is just calculation, but before that happens we need to figure out the
    final step - how do we take care of the $x_i$'s appearing in this last inequality?
</p>
<p>
    Here is where the $\min_{\text{all scenarios}}$ comes into play: we need this
    inequality to be true not just for a <i>specific</i> matrix $\mathbf{T}$ but for
    <b>all such</b> matrices.
</p>
<p>
    So we will have to consider the <i>maximum</i> that the quantity
    ${x_i \choose 2} + {{n-x_i} \choose 2}$ can take (where $x_i$ has to
    be an <i>integer</i>). Also, notice that
    this final step is the <b>only place</b> where we are invoking that
    $n$ is <i>odd</i>!
</p>
<p>
    This maximum (over choices of $x_i$) is easily derived since the
    expression ${x_i \choose 2} + {{n-x_i} \choose 2}$ is essentially a
    <i>quadratic</i>. (The reader is invited to check the following Fact
    by oneself, or to click-expand below).
</p>

<!--
<button class="accordion">Proof of (2)</button>
-->
<button class="accordion">
    Fact: $\max \{{x_i \choose 2} + {{n-x_i} \choose 2}\} \leqslant \frac{n^2 -1}{4}$ for $n$ odd
</button>

<div class="panel">
    <p>
Let $n = 2t + 1$ (since $n$ is odd).

        The expression ${x_i \choose 2} + {{n-x_i} \choose 2}$ simplifies as
        $\frac{x_i^2 + (n-x_i)^2 - n}{2}$. We can forget about constants for the
        purpose of this calculation (such as $n$, $2$), so we are essentially
        <i>maximizing</i> $x_i^2 + (n-x_i)^2$.
</p>
    <p>
        Now this is easy. By differentiation or appealing to AM-GM, we can see that
        this maximum is achieved when $x_i$ is (roughly) half of $n$. However, since
        $n$ is odd and $x_i$ has to be an integer, it cannot happen that $x_i$ is
        <i>exactly</i> half of $n$. So the roughly translates to $n = 2t + 1$,
        $x_i = t$ (or $t+1$).
    </p>
    <p>Calculating the expression for $x_i = t = (n-1)/2$ gives the result.</p>
</div>

Finally, we have the overall inequality:
$$
m \frac{n^2 - 1}{4} \leqslant k {n \choose 2}
$$
which yields the desired inequality: $k/m \geqslant (n-1)/2n$.

<h4>Takeaways</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Can the reader see where $2$ entered the problem? The answer: because there are <b>two</b>
        categories in which the entries of the original matrix $\mathbf{M}$
        are classified (Pass or Fail). I invite the reader to
        <i>construct</i> his/her own problem for when there are <b>three</b> possibilities
        instead of $2$ (say, each Judge labels each Candidate one of {Good, Moderate, Bad}).
    </li>
    <li>
        For <i>even</i> $n$: the reader is invited to check that in this case, the
        resulting inequality is
        $$
        \frac{k}{m} \geqslant \frac{n-2}{2(n-1)}
        $$
        i.e. the <i>same</i> as for the case of the <i>odd</i> number $(n-1)$. This was surprising
        to me - would appreciate comments as to why this happened!
    </li>
    <li>
        We note that this problem has a <i>minimax</i> objective. What if we were to
        consider other objectives - such as the <i>average number of agreements</i>
        over judge pairs?
    </li>
</ul>
